  abstract="Sosemanuk is a new synchronous software-oriented stream cipher, corresponding to ProfileÂ 1 of the ECRYPT call for stream cipher primitives. Its key length is variable between 128 and 256Â bits. It accommodates a 128-bit initial value. Any key length is claimed to achieve 128-bit security. The Sosemanuk cipher uses both some basic design principles from the stream cipher SNOWÂ 2.0 and some transformations derived from the block cipher SERPENT. Sosemanuk aims at improving SNOWÂ 2.0 both from the security and from the efficiency points of view. Most notably, it uses a faster IV-setup procedure. It also requires a reduced amount of static data, yielding better performance on several architectures.",

  abstract="A randomized encryption procedure enciphers a message by randomly choosing a ciphertext from a set of ciphertexts corresponding to the message under the current encryption key. At the cost of increasing the required bandwidth, such procedures may achieve greater cryptographic security than their deterministic counterparts by increasing the apparent size of the message space, eliminating the threat of chosen plaintext attacks, and improving the a priori statistics for the inputs to the encryption algorithms. In this paper we explore various ways of using randomization in encryption.",

  abstract="The database-as-a-service (DAS) model is a newly emerging computing paradigm, where the DBMS functions are outsourced. It is desirable to store data on database servers in encrypted form to reduce security and privacy risks since the server may not be fully trusted. But this usually implies that one has to sacrifice functionality and efficiency for security. Several approaches have been proposed in recent literature for efficiently supporting queries on encrypted databases. These approaches differ from each other in how the index of attribute values is created. Random one-to-one mapping and order-preserving are two examples. In this paper we will adapt a prefix-preserving encryption scheme to create the index. Certainly, all these approaches look for a convenient trade-off between efficiency and security. In this paper we will discuss the security issues and efficiency of these approaches for supporting range queries on encrypted numeric data.",
