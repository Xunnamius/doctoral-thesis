\chapter{Code Availability} \label{app:availability}

This appendix provides links for the StrongBox, SwitchCrypt, and HASCHK source
code. The two libraries/APIs that StrongBox and SwitchCrypt rely on are
additionally provided. Note that resource locations, URLs, frameworks,
interfaces, etc. will likely change overtime, while this text remains static.

We also make our HASCHK frontend and DHT backend components available open
source for the benefit of the community. We also make publicly available our
evaluation environment: a patched HotCRP instance.

You can find instructions on how to build, test, and modify the StrongBox source
in the provided README documentation linked below. Our hope is that this work
motivates further exploration of resource integrity and other SCA mitigation
strategies and leads to further progress on more exotic FDE schemes.
