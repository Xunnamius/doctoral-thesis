\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion} This paper advocates for a more agile
approach to FDE where the storage system can dynamically alter the tradeoffs
between security and latency/energy. To support this vision of agile encryption,
we have proposed an interface that allows multiple stream ciphers with different
input and output characteristics to be composed in a generic manner. We have
identified three strategies for using this interface to switch ciphers
dynamically, but with low overhead. We have also proposed a scoring method for
determining when to use one cipher over another. Our case studies show how
different strategies can be used to achieve different goals in practice. We
believe that agile encryption will become increasingly important as successful
systems are increasingly required to balance conflicting operational
requirements. We hope that this work inspires further research into achieving
this balance. It is publicly available open-source\footnoteref{note1}.
