Recent work on Full Drive Encryption shows that stream ciphers achieve
significantly improved performance over block ciphers while offering stronger
security guarantees. However, optimizing for performance often conflicts with
other key concerns like energy usage and desired security properties. In this
paper we present SwitchCrypt, a software mechanism that navigates the tradeoff
space made by balancing competing security and latency requirements via
\emph{cipher switching} in space or time. Our key insight in achieving
low-overhead switching is to leverage the overwrite-averse, append-mostly
behavior of underlying solid-state storage to trade throughput for reduced
energy use and/or certain security properties. We implement SwitchCrypt on an
ARM big.LITTLE mobile processor and test its performance under the popular F2FS
LFS. We provide empirical results demonstrating the conditions under which
different switching strategies are optimal through the exploration of four cases
studies. In one study, where we require the filesystem to react to a shrinking
energy budget by switching ciphers, we find that SwitchCrypt achieves up to a
3.3x total energy use reduction compared to a static approach using only the
Freestyle stream cipher. In another case, where we allow the user to manually
switch between ChaCha20 and Freestyle stream ciphers dynamically, we achieve a
1.6x to 4.8x reduction in I/O latency compared to prior static approaches.
