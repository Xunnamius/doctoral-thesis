The security of data at rest---widely understood as FDE or Full-Drive
Encryption---is an important concern among several in modern computer systems.
These concerns exist in contention over a set of finite resources. For instance:
a device that is battery-constrained must remain within its energy budget which
may change over time, e.g. when a device enters ``battery-saver mode'';
regardless, this device must meet certain performance guarantees or the user
experience will suffer; above all, the data on the device must be secure from
adversaries; and the device has a finite amount of drive space available. At any
given moment we trade battery life for performance, performance for security,
security for drive space, and so on. Unfortunately, designing a FDE system that
can navigate such treacherous tradeoffs efficiently, effectively, and with
respect to performance and security guarantees is entirely non-trivial. This
dissertation explores this space of tradeoffs and how we might optimize for one
concern without violating another given kernel and userland goals that shift
over time.
